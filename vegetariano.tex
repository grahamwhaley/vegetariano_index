% This is the 'temporary' scratch document that is the first step in generating
% the index for the Vegetariano book.
%
% This scratch document generates a file that includes all the 'temporary workings' of the
% process including snippets all the sections, recipe titles and ingredients. By itself it
% is not really that useful, but can be used to track down 'bugs' and review the index that
% is generated.
%
% Really it is a stepping stone to then generate a standalone index, and then a booklet form
% index for printing.
%
% What this document does contain is all the special commands we use to construct the index
% from notes of the sections, titles and ingredients of the recipes.

%\title{Vegetariano Index}
%\author{Graham Whaley}

% %define our default ingredients list layout
% % Note the nasty hbadness stuff.  As we are cutting the ingredients to two columns,
% % we get some underfull box warnings in 12pt, so this stops them appearing.
% \def\beginingredientslist{\begin{multicols}{2} \hbadness=10000 \begin{itemize}}
% \def\endingredientslist{\end{itemize} \hbadness=1000 \end{multicols}}

% Later we may want to adjust this to be 4 columns of tiny font - but whilst deveoping it is
% easier to view as 2 columns of scriptsize
\usepackage[makeindex]{imakeidx}
\indexsetup{othercode=\scriptsize}
\makeindex[columns=2]

% We spit out the actual arguments as text as well as adding them to the index as then in the 'raw'
% document we get actual pages-per-recipe. If we did not then \newpage would effectively get ignored
% and everything would end up on the first, blank, page. We can probably do this 'better' if we force
% a newpage in the actual body of the text, but it's sort of useful to have the ingredients and stuff
% dumped out in the raw text file to aid debug - and it's easy. This will only become a problem if
% an ingredient list overflows a pagefull, which I think is doubtful (and if it does, we can probably
% fix that later by squishing into a paragraph, or forcing page numbers if we have to. Page numbers
% buried in the body text might be useful later anyway

% Use special commands as variables to carry around the current category and recipe names so we can
% use them with ! separators in the indexing of recipes and ingredients.
\newcommand{\Vcurrentcategory}{xxx}
\def\category #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1} \renewcommand{\Vcurrentcategory}{#1}}

\newcommand{\Vcurrentrecipe}{xxx}
\def\recipe #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1} \index{\Vcurrentcategory!#1} \renewcommand{\Vcurrentrecipe}{#1}}

% Try to cater for multi-page recipes (of which there are so far few...)
% This works in that the main recipe title and section references cover multi-pages, but the
% ingredients still only show the first page. It seems not quite trivial to fix that. I tried
% putting the recipestop() before the ingredients, but that still didn't seem to do it. It's not
% a big problem though.
\def\recipestart #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1|(} \index{\Vcurrentcategory!#1|(} \renewcommand{\Vcurrentrecipe}{#1}}
\def\recipestop #1{ \index{#1|)} \index{\Vcurrentcategory!#1|)} }

% I find it slightly odd that the 'see' cross references don't carry page numbers, but it seems that
% is some sort of 'standard' in indexes, and it is not quite trivial to fix with the default \see
% operation. We'll leave it as be for now.
% Ingredient refs don't carry a photo bold ref either
\def\italianrecipe #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1@\textsl{#1}|see {\Vcurrentrecipe}} }

% 'altsort' lets us set the sort place in the index for oddly named recipes, such as the pasta
% beggining with "'O Sicchio", which otherwise ends up at the front of the index
% Order of arguments: {Real Name}{Sort Name}
\def\italianrecipealtsort #1#2{\hfill \break #1: \index{#2@\textsl{#1}|see {\Vcurrentrecipe}} }
\def\photo #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1|textbf} \index{\Vcurrentcategory!#1|textbf} }

% Add a method to allow references to the current recipe - a bit like 'italianrecipe'. Very useful
% when a recipe contains a hidden sub-recipe (such as how to make a sauce etc.). Do this as a def as
% not only is it 'cleaner', but we need it to expand so we can process the index file later to make
% the single index - outside of this main body text.
% Warning - seems if we hard-code a \Vcurrentrecipe reference outside of a def then it will get
% post-evaluated later, and pick up the wrong recipe name!
\def\refcurrentrecipe #1{\hfill \break #1: \index{#1@\textsl{#1}|see {\Vcurrentrecipe}} }
% Order of arguments: {Real Name}{Sort Name}
\def\refcurrentrecipealtsort #1#2{\hfill \break #1: \index{#2@\textsl{#1}|see {\Vcurrentrecipe}} }

% Later we may make use of the region, although the book itself does contain a region based index.
% For now, insert the data into the file, but do nothing with it.
\def\region #1{}

\def\ingredient #1{#1 \index{#1!\Vcurrentrecipe}}

% ingredient_redundant is used when an ingredient is correct, but really just adds duplication to
% the index. For instance, if we have 'Apricot Dumplings' as the only recipe that uses 'Apricots'
% as an ingredient, then the index looks like:
%
%  Apricot Dumplings, 384
%  Apricots
%    Apricot Dumplings, 384
%
% If we reduce that to the single direct recipe index entry (by dropping the Apricots as an ingredient)
% then we lose nothing in the index (the recipe is still directly findable by looking for 'Apricots',
% but we save 2 lines and make the index cleaner.
%
% This is mostly used when a recipe name starts with the name of an ingredient, and that recipe is
% the only one to use that ingredient (or, possibly all recipes using that ingredient start with
% the name of that ingredient). It may find other uses though. It is kept as a 'live' command so that
% if somebody wishes to re-insert these lines they merely have to change the below command, and not
% do a global search and replace.
