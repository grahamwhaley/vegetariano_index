% Fake up the vegetariano index into its own PDF.
% This is a mild hack, as we need to *not* call makeindex in any form, but then it seems
% rather hard to get printindex to pull in the vegetariano index file.
% We end up using splitindex, and then copying the vegetariano index file over
% in place.... see the Makefile as well.

% Choosing a size really depends on how you are going to print this, and affects how many
% pages the index takes.
% For an A5 booklet print, if we don't mind sacrificing 2 pages from 12 to 14, then 'normalsize'

% Reduce the default margins of the A4 document. Our recipie names are very long, and
% the margins in the physical book itself are more like the below. This not only makes
% the index more readable on the page, but also allows us to squeeze it into fewer pages.
